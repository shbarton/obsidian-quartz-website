Here are some personal projects I've built over the past few years.

LifeTab is a browser extension that shapes your digital environments to you stay focused and build better habits. It replaces your new tab page with a customisable dashboard with features like: 
- A todo list 
- Site blocker 
- Focus timer
- AI assistant 
- Quote of the day

It's something I wished existed for *years* because I couldn't find an app that did quite what I wanted. I think having #ADHD has something to do with it. I've had a lot of business ideas over the years, but this is one that kept haunting me, so I decided to build it. The main justification is that it could turn into a source of income that can replace my need to have Proper Job, so I can focus spending my time on things that I love and think are important.

HoHoHello lets anyone get a personalised videos from Santa for a special little someone, generated by AI. All you need to do is submit some information about a special little someone, and Santa will respond with a video made just for them. 

Towards the end of 2023 I had some contracting hours open up. Instead of looking for a new project, I thought why not build a fun little Christmas project that leveraged a lot of what I had learned over the year working with AI.
