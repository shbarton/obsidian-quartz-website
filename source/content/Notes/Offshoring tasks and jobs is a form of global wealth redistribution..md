This is not 'exploitation' as a lot of people think it is. While some of these folks might get paid less than what minimum wage would be in the origin country, in most cases its far more than they'd expect to get in their own countries. Purchasing power ranges drastically across the world, so that that money will likely have greater impact on their lives and communities than it would than it would if it were paid to someone in the home country.
