Nature has literally had more than a billion years to explore the possibility space of survival-promoting information transfer solutions across life in all its forms. 

Genetic mutations and recombining genetic material via reproduction seems to be too coarse and simple considering the astounding solutions to problems life has come up with across the eons. A lot of energy and computation has been applied in searching for solutions that last!

I think we'll discover something else, could be related to epigenetics, as well as some other emergent information structure that we haven't discovered yet. 

When in doubt, bet on nature having discovered a solution -- we just haven't uncovered it yet.

[[Stuff related to information is so tough to figure out because it's separate, in a way, from the underlying material and it's hard for us to measure or understand the *meaning* of that information and the causal role it plays in a system.]]

[[Consciousness arising from matter is the same sort of thing thing as ideologies, egregores, memes, etc having a life of their own.]]
