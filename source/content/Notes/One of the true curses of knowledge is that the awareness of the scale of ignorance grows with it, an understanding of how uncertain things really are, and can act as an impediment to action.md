You'd think that having more knowledge would make us more confident in our actions, though it paradoxically has the opposite effect. 

Just as a light casts a deeper shadow the brighter it is, as our understanding of the world grows, our awareness of the scale of ignorance grows with it. 

Knowledge always makes us more aware of how uncertain things really are, and this can become an impediment to action.
