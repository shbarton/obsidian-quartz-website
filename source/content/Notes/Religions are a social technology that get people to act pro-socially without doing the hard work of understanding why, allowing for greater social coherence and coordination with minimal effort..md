Religions capture patterns of behaviour that map onto underlying truths about the sorts of actions that are important for the ongoing survival of a group of people (tribe, society, etc). It is less important for religious precepts and principles to be understood than adhered to. By understanding here I mean why they are carried out in that way. In fact, most of the reasons why are a mystery and will likely remain so for some time. 

This is because the proof is in the pudding. The fact that doing these certain things and behaving in a certain way promotes the good in some fashion, knowing why is secondary to the outcomes. 

This is a good thing though! The insights contained in religious texts are incredibly hard won. They are the result of multiple life-times worth of experience, of trial, error, and reflection.

It's far easier to tell people how to behave rather than expect them to acquire this wisdom on their own. There's also an element of faking it until you make it here

The fact that all societies around the world have a religion speaks to this
