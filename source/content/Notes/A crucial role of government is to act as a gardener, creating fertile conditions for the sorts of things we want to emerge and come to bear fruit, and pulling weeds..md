The general idea here is that the one of the crucial roles of the government is to chart a path,  shaping an environment where people and organisations are encouraged to take actions in line with the goals. *Not* to choose winners, because thats impossible to do but to the selective pressures created by society and markets. (see: [[Markets are a distributed computational tool that humanity uses to explore the possibility space of technologies and select the ones that are useful.]])


Things that fit into this metaphor: 
- Fertiliser, watering, etc -> Subsidies, grants, etc 
- Seeding plants in pots, creating plantboxes, etc -> Creating infrastructure that allows smaller, nascent endeavours to sprout.
