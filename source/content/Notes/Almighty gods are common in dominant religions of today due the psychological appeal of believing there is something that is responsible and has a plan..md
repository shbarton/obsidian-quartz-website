The presence of an almighty god in most dominant religions, a creator and architect of the world and all that unfolds, is likely due to there being a tremendous psychological appeal to believing that there is *something* responsible for the world and how it unfolds. Believing this alleviates existential anxiety and can act as a balm for the root of most suffering, uncertainty. This could be one reason why religions with such a omnipotent power have captured the minds of many, it's a more attractive and sticky meme.
