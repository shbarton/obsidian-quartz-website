We can't truly understand the nature of consciousness by focusing on the arrangements and orchestrations of matter that give rise to it no more than we can understand the meaning or nature of:
- a symphony by analysing the physical properties the instruments that combine to create it 
- a work of literature by analysing paper and ink 
- a painting by examining the pigments and brushstrokes used

These examples don't quite feel right to me, there's more than just emergence at play here but i can't quite put my finger on it. I think it has to do with the informational contents and dynamics, the essence or meaning of the informational qualities, the knowledge, the meaning, the something that these expressions of art give rise to. It has a living quality about it which is divorced from the medium through which it's expressed.

[[Stuff related to information is so tough to figure out because it's separate, in a way, from the underlying material and it's hard for us to measure or understand the *meaning* of that information and the causal role it plays in a system.]]
