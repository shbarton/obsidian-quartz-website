arghhh, my heart jumps every time i see a msg and its not from him, gosh, i can really feel this guy and my body can as well. i gotta remind yself its not about stopping the feelings its about recognising that the love i have is so strong and thats so beautiful and i will find and attact people who love me the same, no more energy leechers. i made the mistake of dating a junky with no teeth at one point, i couldnt see their lies and im terrified to let people like that back into my life but ive gotten heaps better with boundaries and can remember that, being here in a new county is scary bc of this past experience and loosing myself but i know i can set them, ive proven that to myself already
