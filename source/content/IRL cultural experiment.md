>>friend noticed ex gf looking at social media stories, tells me. 
>>>i mention tracking the moments she does it, to get to know why (bc he expressed a yearning to know why, so many unanswered questions) 
>>>>came back a week later with answers 
>>>>>"v viewed my stories, ah, its after 10pm on a friday night" - this gave him more a frame of where she is at/why she does this. 
>>>>>
>>>>>
>>>>>"we give ourselves away by our words" - seems related bc we also give ourselves away by our actions. the world isnt built for things to be hidden (maybe, unsure of this one), and the things that are usually hidden are hidden in plain sight. (under rocks, down holes, in logs/trees etc and only for protection...which tracks bc we often use shame and guilt as a way to hide vulnerable pieces of ourselves, to protect ourselves and others from hurt, a natural pccurance in nature and nurture)
