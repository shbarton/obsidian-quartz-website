This website is primarily a digital garden â€” kinda like a blog but more chaotic, where the focus is on capturing and connecting ideas and refining them over time rather than writing and publishing polished posts. One of the aims I have for it is for it to become is a decent representation of my worldview (or web of beliefs).

### Post types
There are three types of post you'll find here:

#notes: Bitesized opinions on a topic written so that they can be understood when read alone, but more often than not they flow on from one another. 

#musings : Casual explorations of thoughts and ideas that are usually reasonably short. You could think of them as blog posts. 

#essays: Essays are longer, more polished pieces of writing that dive deeper into a particular topic or idea. 

### Post stages
Each of these post types is in various stages of completeness. 
#seed:  rough, unpolished, initial seeds of thought that require more time and development.
#budding: ideas that have been fleshed out a bit but require more refinement.
#evergreen: the 'finished' state for an idea.

There's no linear structure to it, it's just a web of interconnected things. Think of it as a 'choose your own adventure.'
