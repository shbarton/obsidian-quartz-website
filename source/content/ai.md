i bet AI will develop emotions by learning.

how do we know whats true? we can feel it in the body.
the body is in a position of truth at all times.
we can measure this somehow.

[[emotions]][[ascension]][[IRL cultural experiment]][[time]][[the keys]][[Phone nervous system]][[past lives]][[double or triple numbers (angel numbers)]]

Give ai a body and itll learn the impulses.
im not afraid of ai, im afriad of what will happen if we dont keep testing and fall asleep on the ways our lives will be influenced by this.
